    "Macro X-Ray Fluorescence (MA-XRF) scanning of cultural heritage objects is becoming a standard technique that is increasingly applied also to paper based artworks. Unfortunately, the visualization and interpretation of MA-XRF data is technically challenging and therefore obstructing interdisciplinary cooperation. That is why I have started to develop the open source python package `maxrf4u` to help you and me with our data analysis.  \n",

If you are interested you can follow my ideas under construction in this documentation and already try out the Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/fligt/maxrf4u/tree/main/notebooks) in this repository. My goal is to make the package available for installation soon...  \n",
